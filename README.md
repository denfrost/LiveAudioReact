# LiveAudioReact

LiveAudioReact is a sample showing how to use WindowsAudioCapture plugin.

AudioBar is a C++ Actor using the WindowsAudioCaptureActor as audio provider.

We can add multiple AudioBar (or any kind of Actor) using the WindowsAudioCaptureActor to manage the capture audio data.

Niagara integration: you can modify particles properties by using audio data (see video)

Both particles type are supported: CPU & GPU
